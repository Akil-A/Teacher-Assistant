# Teacher-Assistant

This is a module of our project. For this module we have implemented the admin section where you can:

* Authenticate with username and password
* Manage students, classes and courses and
* Assign students to classes and courses to classes

We have used Spring MVC as a base framework and design pattern, Hibernate for data management, Spring Security for authentication,
and jQuery to handle some client requests and manipulation.

## Setup

Download [test1.war](target/test1.war). Deploy on your Java web server (we recommend glassfish).
Login with username 'admin' and password 'leet'.
